This code integrates the trajectory of particle in a Duffing oscillator potential. I tried to use Verlet but to get the V_n+1 step, you need F_n+1... but with damping, to get F_n+1, you need V_n+1! Instead, I used Runge-Kutta.

Look in main: there is 1 particle, you can change the intial conditions and potential for it. Also change the time step, dt and the number of steps to suit your problem.
You can straightforwardly add more particles with different initial conditions to simulate simultaneously (they dont interact, so you could also do different independent simulations)

The code then writes the time, pos_1, vel_1 to a file in csv format.

you can read this with plot_poincare. This will plot the 'Strange Attractor' structure or you can edit it (comment out the scatter plot and uncomment the regulat .plot() to plot the position vs time.
