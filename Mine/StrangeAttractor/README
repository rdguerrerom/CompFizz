This code integrates the trajectory of particle in a Duffing oscillator potential. I tried to use Verlet but to get the V_n+1 step, you need F_n+1... but with damping, F_n+1 need V_n+1! Instead, I used Runge-Kutta.

Look in main: there are 2 particles, you can change the intial conditions and potential for each. Also change the time step, dt and the number of steps to suit your problem.

The code then writes the time, pos_1, vel_1, pos_2, vel_2 to a file in csv format.

you can read this with plot_poincare.

NOTE! PlotPoincare doesn't work yet, I need to calculate the energy of the particle to get the actual Poincare section (constant energy slice!). I think Ill do this by computing it in the Main function, then plot an 'imshow' with the energy as the intensity.
