GrowDendrite is the main function. It reads an input file and runs the loop.

There are some example input files in /input_files. 
INPUTFILE is just a basic inputfile.
INPUTFILE_MULTISEED is an example with multiple seed positions
INPUTFILE_ARBITRARY_LAUNCH is an example with a hack to launch from an arbitrary initial point.

All the classes and functions are defined in /modules, so if you move GrowDendrite elsewhere, youll need to modify 'modulepath' in the beginning of the file to point to the modules. 

You can run the simulation as ./GrowDendrite
This will look for 'INPUTFILE' in the working directory. If you have it elsewhere, just pass the path as an argument:

./GrowDendrite input_files/INPUTFILE

Note that this is how you could run the other inputfiles, or you can copy INPUTFILE to the working directory and modify it.


After the simulation finishes, it will save the grid and arrival rates to .csv files for later use. You can change the names of these in the INPUTFILE. Also, you can control whether or not GrowDendrite shows a plot using the SHOW_FIG flag. (set it to != 'True' to turn it off.)

The MAKE_MOVIE flag causes GrowDendrite to write a .png to temporary /images directory at each step. This will create as many pngs as there are particles so use caution! Also note that it will make the simulation much slower since it has to do it each step. Anyway, if you do this, once the simulation finishes, the code will compile the pngs into a mp4 movie. Take a look at Render.py in /modules for more info. You'll need to have ffmpeg installed and in you path for this to work or write you own code to combine the pngs into a movie.

Lastly, PlotDendrite is tool to make a pretty picture from the data. It reads the .csv file where the grid is stored, so be sure to keep track of which file is which if you change the name from the default in INPUTFILE. If you do chane the name, you can plot it by passing it as an argumnet to PlotDendrite

./PlotDendrite YourGrid.csv
